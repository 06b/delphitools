	standfirst: 'Adapted from the UIKit tooling, delphitools now uses the new Canon Design Language and UI Kit, built from the ground up.',

	intro: 'Long time fans of delphitools have been through two redesigns so far. First, when we switched from primitives to shadcn/ui modules, then later when those modules were redesigned with version 1.4. Now, for the first time, all elements in delphitools are new, creative and custom. An interview with the designer.',

	question1: 'Canon is a big departure from the previous style. Why redesign what worked?',

	answer1: "The previous iteration was just... safe. It was boring. I didn't much like it, it didn't take many risks, and it looked like every other website out there. With the powerful layout options that UIKit gave me in the new 2.0 version of the iOS app, I figured we might as well try to port it to web as well.",

	// ∑CG: caption under the live kit components on the left page
	//   spec: 12 words, figure caption, names the components shown (button, segmented control, slider, switch)
	//   sample: "Fig. 1: Real Canon components, drawn by the same code the tools use."
	captionLeft: '∑CG',

	pullQuote: "Anyone can make an interface these days, and that's great. But I do think you owe it to your users to make something special, make something with love.",

	question2: 'So Canon started as an iOS only idea, and then moved to web?',

	answer2: "That's right. I initially expected the web version to be a lot more compact and simple, since many of the UIKit options (like a reliable 3D transform) simply weren't available, but I'm pleased to say it wasn't too difficult.",

	question3: 'The biggest change is the typeface situation. Why change this?',

	answer3: "While I love iA Writer Quattro, our previous font, I did feel like it was an overly safe and boring choice. Recently, I've been using Open Sans Condensed a lot, and kind of fell in love with it. As for the mono change from Plex to Iosevka, you'll have to thank my esteemed colleague Ash for that.",

	// ∑CG: caption under the live settings panel on the right page
	//   spec: 12 words, figure caption, names the parts shown (rows, heading, stepper, lamps)
	//   sample: "Fig. 2: A settings pane, assembled from Canon rows."
